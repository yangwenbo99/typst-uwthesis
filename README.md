# typst-uwthesis

This is a [typst](https://typst.app/) template that should (almost) satisfy the [University of Waterloo's thesis formatting requirements](https://uwaterloo.ca/graduate-studies-postdoctoral-affairs/current-students/thesis/thesis-formatting).  The resulted document is similar to, but not exactly the same as the [LaTeX template](https://uwaterloo.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ISTKB/pages/2666037269/LaTeX+Software+for+Thesis+and+Document+Preparation+and+the+Overleaf+Cloud+Service). 


## License

Placeholders in the example file might contain copyrighted example texts obtained from UW's IST.  By the time you complete you thesis, all copyrighted texts will have been removed. 

Currently, there should be no legal problem for a UW student to use this template.  We have plan to release the template under an Apache license similar to [simple-typst-thesis's](https://github.com/zagoli/simple-typst-thesis) after getting rid of the potentially copyrighted texts.  If you need this template soon, feel free to replace the text by non-copyrighted material and submit a pull request.
